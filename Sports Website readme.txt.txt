This webpage has 4 HTML pages and 4 CSS pages with contribute
to each file of their own. Each page and tab leads to a
seperate html page which represents it's own information.
All the coding in the HTML files work and no errors were found.
The same can be said on the CSS files as they make each page
different by changing the colors and having different
information of course. My goal was to make an webpage where
Sports information can be displayed and i think i did a good job
providing that information.
I added on page 3 where you click the link and it sends you to the NFL playoff picture
I also added a logo to the website as i mentioned when i first drew the bluprints.
All the pages share a similar layout but each page has different information but keeps the
websites name and logo at the top
