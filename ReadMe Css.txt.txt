 SportsApp.css file
The CSS is formatted into a 3 collum design where the right collum 
has scheduled games for the leagues the middle collum has the
sports news and the left collunm has the different leagues and 
when you click on them it will eventually lead you to those pages.
The top portion is meant for links to news, sports, etc. and the name of the page
as well as the logo when it is themn created. There is improvment but
ill do more further on.
